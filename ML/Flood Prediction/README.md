This model predicts the posiibility of flooding using logistic regression. 

### Dataset

Dataset contains details of the amount of rainfall occurring throughout the year in a particular state for the years 1901 to 2015.

For our model, we have used Kerala as an example. However, it can be modified for prediction for any state of India.

### Parameters
The parameters fed into the model are the amount of rainfall in the months March-May, the average amount of rainfall in the first 10 days of June and the difference in the amount of rainfall in the months of May and June.
The selection of months is specific for Kerala as monsoon starts in the month of June. Other months will be used for input for other states. 
### Accuracy
We get an accuracy of 88.3%.
